# Web-Studio

Web-Studio is a responsive HTML layout created with SASS preprocessor. It is designed to adapt to three different screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop, following the BEM methodology. Additionally, all images have been optimized for various device resolutions (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

## Figma Design

## Pages

The Web-Studio application consists of two main pages:

1. **Homepage:** This page provides general information about the application, its features, and services.

2. **Portfolio:** The portfolio page displays a list of services offered by the company, showcasing their expertise and capabilities.

## Styling

To ensure a consistent look and feel across different web browsers, the project uses the `modern-normalize` stylesheet to normalize styles and layout.
